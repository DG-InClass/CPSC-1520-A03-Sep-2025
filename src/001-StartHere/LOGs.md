## Version Control & Markdown Intro

*At the end of this lesson, you should be able to...*

- [ ] Describe what is meant by "version control"
  - Version control is way to save the history of how my software changes over time. Version control is all about saving the **source code** (and *documentation*) in my repository.
- [ ] Identify the version control system used in this course
  - We are using **git**, which is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS).
- [ ] List the three primary states of a file in Git
  - Untracked - These are files that are not (yet) part of our git history.
  - Modified - These are files that are in our git history, but we've made some changes to them. The changes exist, but we havn't yet **staged** them for a commit.
  - Staged - These files have changes and are ready to be committed as part of our git history.
- [ ] List seven of the most common Git commands
  - `git status`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "Some message"`, `git push`, `git pull`, `git merge`, and `git log`
- [ ] Configure Git to use your name and email address
  - *Dan's CPSC-1520 website has notes on that (look under the System Setup tutorial)*
- [ ] Explain the purpose of the `.gitignore` file
  - It lists all the folders and files that we *don't* want in our git history (that we do not want to track)
- [ ] Create and synchronize commits as a means of submitting your work
  - *This is a skill which comes with practice...*
- [x] Describe the purpose and basic principles of Markdown syntax
  - It allows you to focus on the **content** of documentation rather than the *presentation* of your documentation.
- [ ] Create notes written in Markdown format
- [ ] List four common commands used in the terminal
- [ ] Identify the keyboard shortcuts for opening the terminal inside and outside of VS Code
- [ ] Identify the keyboard shortcut to open the command palette in VS Code
- [ ] Perform basic tasks in the terminal related to navigation and version control
